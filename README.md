# Sergi Vos  Bosch
This is my very own personal website where I frequently commit changes. Here you may find my portofolio, my skills and a short about-me text. Here are some of the stuff I've used:

  - HTML5
  - Javascript (+few jQuery)
  - CSS3
  - Fontawesome for contact footer
  - Coffe & Magic
